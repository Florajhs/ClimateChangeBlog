      <h1>Melting Ice Caps</h1>
      <p>The melting of the glaciers, a phenomenon that intensified in the 20th century, is leaving our planet iceless. Human activity is the mainn culprit in the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 
         The sea level and global stability depend on how these great masses of recrystallized snow evolve.

      <p>The Earth's glaciers have been silently retreating fro more than half a century as climate change inexorably marches on. There is no place on the planet - except south-east Asia - capable of withstanding the effect of a phenomenon that has melted
         more than 9.6 billion tonnes of glacial ice in the world since 1961, according to a 2019 satellite study by the Unervisity of Zurich(Switzerland), and threatens to evaporate over a third of all glaciers by 2100, according to the World Widlife Fund.
      </p>
      <h3>WHAT IS A GLACIER AND HOW DOES IT FORM ?</h3>
        <p>These massive blocks of moving ice arise as snow accumulated in cold places compacts and recrystallizes, as is the case, for example, in mountain and polar glaciers, which should not be confused with the gigantic Arctic plates. Glaciers are classified according to their morphology — ice fields, cirque glaciers, valley glaciers, etc. — the climate — polar, tropical or temperate — and their thermal conditions — cold, hot or polythermal base —.
        The formation of a glacier takes millennia, and its size varies depending on the amount of ice it retains throughout its lifespan. The behaviour of these masses is reminiscent of that of the rivers they feed during thaws, and their speed depends on friction and the slope of the terrain over which they move. In total, glaciers cover 10% of the Earth's surface and, along with the ice caps, account for nearly 70% of the world's fresh water.
      </p>
      <h3>WHY DO GLACIERS MELT? CAUSES</h3>
        <p>The rising temperature of the Earth has, without doubt, been responsible for melting glaciers throughout history. Today, the speed with which climate change is progressing might render them extinct in record time. Let us take a detailed look at the causes behind glacial melting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CO2 emission: the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) produced by industry, transport, deforestation and burning fossil fuels, amongst other human activities, warm the planet and cause glaciers to melt.</li>
        <li>Ocean warming: oceans absorb 90% of the Earth's warmth, and this fact affects the melting of marine glaciers, which are mostly located near the poles and on the coasts of Alaska (United States).</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>
      </p>
      <h3>EFECTS OF MELTIING GLACIERS</h3>
        <p>The aforementioned study, the University of Zurich revealed that glacial melting has accelerated over the last three decades. This loss of ice has already reached 335 billion tonnes per year, which is 30% of the current rate of ocean growth. The main consequences of deglaciation are:</p>
      <ul>
        <h4><li>Sea level rise</li></h4><br>
        <p>Glacial melting has contributed to raising sea levels by 2.7 centimeters since 1961. Furthermore, the world's glaciers contain enough ice — about 170,000 cubic kilometres — to raise sea levels by nearly half a metre.</p>

        <h4><li>Impact on the climate</li></h4><br>
        <p>Glacial thawing at the poles is slowing the oceanic currents, a phenomenon related to altering the global climate and a succession of increasingly extreme weather events throughout the globe.</p>
        
        <h4><li>Disappearance of species</li></h4><br>
        <p>Glacial melting will also cause the extinction of numerous species, as glaciers are the natural habitat of a number of animals, both terrestrial and aquatic.</p>
        
        <h4><li>Less fresh water</li></h4><br>
        <p>The disappearance of glaciers also means less water for consumption by the population, a lower hydroelectric energy generation capacity, and less water available for irrigation.</p>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>SOLUTIONS TO AVOID MELTING GLACIERS</h3>
        Glaciologists believe that, despite the massive ice loss, we do still have time to save the glaciers from their predicted disappearance. Here are some ideas and proposals for how we can help achieve this goal:
      <ul>
        <h4><li>Stop climate change</li></h4><br>
        <p>In order to curtail climate change and save the glaciers, it is indispensable that global CO2 emissions be reduced by 45 % over the next decade, and that they fall to zero after 2050.</p>
        
        <h4><li>Slow down their erosion</li></h4><br>
        <p>The scientific journal Nature suggested building a 100-metre-long dam in front of the Jakobshavn glacier (Greenland), the worst affected by Arctic melting, to contain its erosion.</p>
        
        <h4><li>Combine artificial icebergs</li></h4><br>
        <p>Indonesian architect Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha won an award for his project Refreeze the Arctic, which consists of collecting water from melted glaciers, desalinating it and refreezing it to create large hexagonal ice blocks. 
           Thanks to their shape, these icebergs could then be combined to create frozen masses.</p>
        
        <h4><li>Increase their thickness</li></h4><br>
        <p>The University of Arizona proposed a seemingly simple solution: manufacture more ice. Their proposal consists of collecting ice from below the glacier through pumps driven by wind power to spread it over the upper ice caps, so that it will freeze, thus strengthening the consistency.</p>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advantages of Wind Turbines</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Harnessing Renewable Energy:</li>
        Wind turbines capitalize on the abundant and renewable resource of wind, offering a clean and sustainable solution to electricity generation. Unlike fossil fuels, wind power does not deplete natural resources or contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
    
        <li>Environmental Friendliness:</li>
        By relying on wind power, wind turbines help combat climate change and air pollution. They produce electricity without emitting harmful greenhouse gases or pollutants associated with traditional energy sources, thereby reducing the carbon footprint.</p>
    
        <li>Energy Independence:</li>
        Wind energy enhances energy security by diversifying the energy mix and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. This reduces vulnerability to price fluctuations and supply disruptions, promoting greater energy independence.</p>
    
        <li>Job Creation and Economic Benefits:</li>
        Wind energy projects stimulate local economies by creating job opportunities in manufacturing, construction, operations, and maintenance. Additionally, wind farms generate tax revenue and lease payments to landowners, contributing to the economic growth of surrounding communities.</p>
    
        <li>Land Use Compatibility:</li>
        One advantage of wind turbines is their ability to coexist with agricultural activities. Farmers can continue utilizing their land for crops or livestock while benefiting from the additional income generated by hosting wind turbines.</p>

      <h2>New Climate Protest In London</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="Images/Image3.jpg" alt="Image3">
        <figcaption><em>Love Our Planet</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Thousands of climate protesters picketed government departments and filled the streets of Westminster on the first day of the Big One, a mass demonstration by 200 different groups headed by Extinction Rebellion (XR).</p>
      <p>The goal was to build a wide coalition, including bigger groups such as Avaaz, Friends of the Earth and Keep Britain Tidy, plus local and community groups, in order to bring people to a climate crisis protest who may have been less comfortable with the acts of direct action and civil disobedience that attracted public anger.</p>
      <p>The demo followed an announcement by XR in the new year that they were stepping back from disruptive action.</p>
      <p>Outside the Department for Transport the crowd held “Stop HS2” placards, while a large banner outside the Department of Health read “Time for a climate public health campaign”.</p>
      <p>Outside Defra, Great Peter Street had been closed off by prior arrangement with the police to hold a street party. In front of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero a colourful group carried out an act of “discobedience” – dancing to the Bee Gees song Stayin’ Alive.</p>
      <p>Some of the nearby protesters seemed to welcome the change of direction. “I only joined eight weeks ago,” said Andrew Magowan, who had taken the train down from the Scottish Borders to join in the weekend. “I’ve followed these issues for a long time but when Extinction Rebellion announced at Christmas they were changing tactics it changed things for me.” He pointed to the energetic, cheerful dancers and said: “That’s why I’ve come – to get inspired and motivated and then go back home and do more about this. We need to bring people with us.”</p>
      <p>A little closer to the Palace of Westminster, at the Scientists for XR stall, Beth Sawyer, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Westminster, had been present. She had stated, "Climate change is actually very much like an infectious disease, in the sense that the solutions are political, not just medical. We know what the problem is, and we know the solution. It's a political decision not to save lives."</p>
      <p>During the week, there had been some concern and confusion over the announcement made by XR that they were making two demands to the government: to cease all new fossil fuel projects and to establish emergency citizens' assemblies. XR had stated that if there was no response by 5 pm the following Monday, the group would initiate "unprecedented" civil disobedience. One protester had expressed her lack of understanding regarding the implications and direction of this announcement, as she did not wish to return to previous disruptive actions.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations continued throughout the weekend and into Monday. On Saturday, which happened to be Earth Day, protesters had been anticipated to don animal costumes, wear masks, carry placards, and play wildlife sounds from speakers as part of the Big Biodiversity March. As a demonstration of the urgency of ecological collapse, they had planned to disperse and lie down in front of parliament for five minutes in silence, symbolizing a "die-in."</p>
      <p>According to the UN, an estimated one million species are at risk of extinction. Charlie Gardner, an Extinction Rebellion activist from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, had stated, "The traditional conservation movement is losing nature in our country, and I believe ordinary people want to do more. This weekend's event can offer an opportunity to accomplish that."</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson had stated, "We had been in contact with the Extinction Rebellion organizers leading up to their event, and we will continue to engage with them throughout the duration, aiming to prevent significant disruption and delays to London's communities and other events taking place in the city."</p>
      <p>The spokesperson further added, "In addition to a substantial policing response, we will deploy specialized officers to handle situations where protesters lock or glue themselves to street furniture or purpose-built structures. When protests cross the line into criminal activities, we will respond promptly, remove and arrest activists as necessary, and restore normalcy as soon as possible. I urge individuals not to take matters into their own hands."</p>
