# ClimateChangeBlog

As part of the project to create a blog on climate change : 
I learned to work within a group setting. This involved task allocation and collaboration, discussing the aesthetic direction our blog should take.
We utilized Github to track our work in real-time.
I was also able to put into practice what I studied in HTML/CSS.
