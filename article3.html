        <p>Thousands of climate protesters picketed government departments and filled the streets of Westminster on the first day of the Big One, a mass demonstration by 200 different groups headed by Extinction Rebellion (XR).</p>
        <p>The goal was to build a wide coalition, including bigger groups such as Avaaz, Friends of the Earth and Keep Britain Tidy, plus local and community groups, in order to bring people to a climate crisis protest who may have been less comfortable with the acts of direct action and civil disobedience that attracted public anger.</p>
        <p>The demo followed an announcement by XR in the new year that they were stepping back from disruptive action.</p>
        <p>Outside the Department for Transport the crowd held “Stop HS2” placards, while a large banner outside the Department of Health read “Time for a climate public health campaign”.</p>
        <p>Outside Defra, Great Peter Street had been closed off by prior arrangement with the police to hold a street party. In front of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero a colourful group carried out an act of “discobedience” – dancing to the Bee Gees song Stayin’ Alive.</p>
        <p>Some of the nearby protesters seemed to welcome the change of direction. “I only joined eight weeks ago,” said Andrew Magowan, who had taken the train down from the Scottish Borders to join in the weekend. “I’ve followed these issues for a long time but when Extinction Rebellion announced at Christmas they were changing tactics it changed things for me.” He pointed to the energetic, cheerful dancers and said: “That’s why I’ve come – to get inspired and motivated and then go back home and do more about this. We need to bring people with us.”</p>
        <p>A little closer to the Palace of Westminster, at the Scientists for XR stall, Beth Sawyer, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Westminster, had been present. She had stated, "Climate change is actually very much like an infectious disease, in the sense that the solutions are political, not just medical. We know what the problem is, and we know the solution. It's a political decision not to save lives."</p>
        <p>During the week, there had been some concern and confusion over the announcement made by XR that they were making two demands to the government: to cease all new fossil fuel projects and to establish emergency citizens' assemblies. XR had stated that if there was no response by 5 pm the following Monday, the group would initiate "unprecedented" civil disobedience. One protester had expressed her lack of understanding regarding the implications and direction of this announcement, as she did not wish to return to previous disruptive actions.</p>
        <p>The demonstrations continued throughout the weekend and into Monday. On Saturday, which happened to be Earth Day, protesters had been anticipated to don animal costumes, wear masks, carry placards, and play wildlife sounds from speakers as part of the Big Biodiversity March. As a demonstration of the urgency of ecological collapse, they had planned to disperse and lie down in front of parliament for five minutes in silence, symbolizing a "die-in."</p>
        <p>According to the UN, an estimated one million species are at risk of extinction. Charlie Gardner, an Extinction Rebellion activist from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology, had stated, "The traditional conservation movement is losing nature in our country, and I believe ordinary people want to do more. This weekend's event can offer an opportunity to accomplish that."</p>
        <p>A police spokesperson had stated, "We had been in contact with the Extinction Rebellion organizers leading up to their event, and we will continue to engage with them throughout the duration, aiming to prevent significant disruption and delays to London's communities and other events taking place in the city."</p>
        <p>The spokesperson further added, "In addition to a substantial policing response, we will deploy specialized officers to handle situations where protesters lock or glue themselves to street furniture or purpose-built structures. When protests cross the line into criminal activities, we will respond promptly, remove and arrest activists as necessary, and restore normalcy as soon as possible. I urge individuals not to take matters into their own hands."</p>
